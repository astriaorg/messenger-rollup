# Example Messenger Rollup
Set up Execution API dependencies (protobufs and gRPC):

```bash
go get buf.build/gen/go/astria/execution-apis/grpc/go
go get buf.build/gen/go/astria/execution-apis/protocolbuffers/go
```

Set up Sequencer Client and Tendermint RPC types dependencies:
```bash
go get "github.com/astriaorg/go-sequencer-client"
go get "github.com/cometbft/cometbft"
```

## Running the rollup w/ docker-compose

```bash
just docker-run
```

This will launch a local sequencer, conductor, the rollup, and the chat frontend.

### Reset rollup data

```bash
just docker-reset
```

### Rebuild rollup images

You might need to rebuild the rollup docker images

```bash
just docker-build
```
